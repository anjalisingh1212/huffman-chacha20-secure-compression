	"In Quiet Code"

In quiet rooms where logic streams,
A mind ignites with silent dreams.
No paint, no pen, just thoughts in flight,
And glowing keys in screen-lit night.

The world outside may never see,
The whispered war of if and C.
But line by line, and bit by byte,
A universe takes shape in light.

Mistakes may crash, or loops may stall,
Yet through it all—you debug all.
Each bug, a beast; each test, a flame,
Until the final “run” proclaims.

So here's to you, who dares to write
New worlds from sparks in endless night—
A coder, poet, builder, mage—
Inkless scribe upon the page.

 "Ode to a Segfault"

I wrote my code with love and care,
Declared my ptr, it pointed… where?
A loop too far, a byte too free,
And now the core belongs to me.

The buffer small, the index bold,
It reached beyond what it could hold.
The system sighs, the debugger hums,
“Segmentation fault,” it softly drums.

But every crash, a chance to learn—
To trace the stack, to twist and turn.
So check your bounds and malloc right,
And let your code run clean tonight.
